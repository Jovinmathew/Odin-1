    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Hard boiled eggs</em></strong> are great food to have on hand as their uses are so versatile. Not
        only are they super delicious on their own, but theyâ€™re great in sandwiches, chopped up on salads and the
        foundation for all devilled eggs. The trick to great hard boiled eggs is not over-cooking them, which can leave
        a grey ring around the yolk and make their texture a bit rubbery.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A pot with lid</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your eggs in a single layer on the bottom of your pot and cover with cold water.</li>
        <li>Bring your eggs to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let stand in water for 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain water and immediately run cold water over eggs.</li>
    </ol>

    <em>I hate hard boiled eggs with all of my heart. As a kid I used to like the yolk but not the white (albumen).
        Pepper it up and enjoy the yolk but the white was just yuuuck. Now, I don't like the yolk anymore, the weird
        texture is like a poorly mixed dough idk, but the albumen tastes a bit better now. Overall, I just hate hard boiled
        eggs. Seasoning helps.</em>
